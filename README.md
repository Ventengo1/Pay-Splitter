# Pay-Splitter

This Household Splitter which I renamed DollaDivide, simplifies managing shared expenses. It allows household/group members to easily add and track expenses, specifying who paid and who participated in the split. The application then calculates real-time balances, showing who owes whom. You can also view a detailed expense history and clear past entries as needed. Finally, a visual summary provides clear insights into spending patterns, making financial transparency effortless. 

Sometimes streamlit will ask to get the app back up and running and all you need to click is yes and wait about 20 seconds.

I used AI for help finding some images and coming up with some of the text.

This app was made for Hack Club's Summer of Making program
