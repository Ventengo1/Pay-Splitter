# Pay-Splitter

This Household Splitter which I renamed DollaDivide, simplifies managing shared expenses. It allows household/group members to easily add and track expenses, specifying who paid and who participated in the split. The application then calculates real-time balances, showing who owes whom. You can also view a detailed expense history and clear past entries as needed. Finally, a visual summary provides clear insights into spending patterns, making financial transparency effortless. 

I used AI for help finding some images and coming up with some of the text.

This app was made for Hack Club's Summer of Making program
